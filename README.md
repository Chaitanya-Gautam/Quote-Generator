# Quote Generator App 📜

This is a simple React-based web application that generates random quotes. The app fetches a collection of quotes from the [Type.fit API](https://type.fit/api/quotes) and displays a random quote along with its author. Users can click the "New Quote" button to get a new random quote.

## Features 🌟

- **Random Quotes:** The app fetches quotes from the Type.fit API and displays a randomly selected quote on load.


## Technologies Used 💻

- React: The app is built using the React library for building user interfaces.
