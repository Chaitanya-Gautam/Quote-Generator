# Quote Generator App ðŸ“œ

This is a simple React-based web application that generates random quotes. The app fetches a collection of quotes from the [Quotes_API](https://github.com/Chaitanya-Gautam/Quotes_API/) and displays a random quote along with its author. Users can click the "New Quote" button to get a new random quote.

## Features ðŸŒŸ

- **Random Quotes:** The app fetches quotes from the Type.fit API and displays a randomly selected quote on load.


## Technologies Used ðŸ’»

- React: The app is built using the React library for building user interfaces.
- useState Hook: Used to manage state variables for quotes and the current displayed quote.
